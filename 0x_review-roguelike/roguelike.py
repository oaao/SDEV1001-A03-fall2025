OK, so you got horribly pranked by a cruel & mischievous README scroll.

It happens -- it's not like you've never met a troll before; it's just
not how you expected a magic piece of paper to behave. Lesson learned.

But look at the bright side:
Being able to warp the fabric of reality is *pretty* sick. You just need to
figure out a little more about how magic works, and you'll be free in no time. 

Maybe reality might bend to your will more easily if you choose its name?

And while we're at it, let's revoke pranking privileges from that stupid scroll.
*We* get to pick the loading screen for our new reality, thank you very much.
