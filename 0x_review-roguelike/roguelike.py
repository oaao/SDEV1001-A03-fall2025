Know what's cool? 
With everything you've learned so far, you can already make a text-based roguelike game!

We'll be building this out layer by layer, and using git to navigate between different
development stages of the game. You'll also learn a few new concepts & techniques beyond
what we've covered so far in the course material.

If you find this fun & helpful, 
I'll keep building the game out based on the new concepts we learn every week!

# You awaken to.........  nothing!?

# You cannot see; your voice makes no sound.
# It's not *cold* here, but you can't remember what warmth even feels like.

# Oh... that's why. Your body isn't even there.
# Curse that foul magic from the land of Git!

# That stupid scroll told you to "run the program" when you arrived.
# You don't know what that means, but you'll try it anyway...
#                                              it seems to be your only option.

   Behold, adventurer: You find yourself in a loveless, timeless void.
      
   By meddling with the mortifying power of the devious README scroll,
   your naïve incantations have broken apart the continuity of time itself!
