# Exercises Intro to Programming

The exercise files in this folder are **starter templates**, just like your labs/assignments â€” not completed code.

Doing the exercise means completing the code-writing (according to instructions below) to solve them!

In later modules for this course, solutions will be added after the classes we'll do the exercises in.

---

## Exercise 1
1. Open the `fix_me.py` file in VS Code.
2. Run the program by typing `python fix_me.py` in the terminal and pressing enter.
3. Fix the errors in the program so that it runs correctly. Use your debugging skills learned in the previous lesson to help you.
4. Run the project again and make sure it works correctly.

5. (optional) You can run `python tests_do_not_touch\test_fix_me.py` to see if your program is working correctly.

## Exercise 2
1. Create a file named `user_input_exercise.py` in this folder.
2. using the `input` function ask the user for their favourite food. "What is your favourite food?" and store the result in a variable named `food`.
3. print out to the user "Your favourite food is: " and then the food they entered.
4. Run the project and make sure it works correctly.
5. (Optional) you can run `python tests_do_not_touch\test_user_input_exercise.py` to see if your program is working correctly.

## Exercise 3
One acre of land is equal to 43,560 square feet. Write a program that asks the user to enter the total square feet in a tract of land and calculates the number of acres in the tract.
1. Do you work in the `acres.py`
2. Get the input from the user and convert it to an `int` (integer)
3. Write the output should work look like below.
```
$ python acres.py
Acre to Square foot converter. How many acres do you have? 25
You have 25 acres
Which is equal to: 1089000 square feet
```
1. Run the project and make sure it works correctly.
2. The user input should be converted to an `int` (integer)
3. (Optional) you can run `python tests_do_not_touch\test_acres.py` to see if your program is working correctly. Note that it needs to look like the output for it to work.

## Exercise 4
Write a program that asks the user to enter three test scores. The program should display each test score, as well as the average test of the users' scores.
1. Do you work in `scores.py`
2. The user input should be converted to a `float` (decimal number)
3. the output should work look like this:
```
$ python scores.py
Enter the first test score: 10
Enter the second test score: 20
Enter the third test score: 30
Test Score 1: 10.0
Test Score 2: 20.0
Test Score 3: 30.0
Average Score: 20.0
```
4. (Optional) you can run `python tests_do_not_touch\test_scores.py` to see if your program is working correctly. Note that it needs to look like the output for it to work.

## Exercise 5 
A bag of cookies holds 40 cookies. The calorie information on the bag claims that there are 10 "servings" in the bag and that a serving equals 300 calories. Write a program that asks the user to input how many cookies they ate and then reports how many total calories were consumed.
1. Do your work in `cookies.py`
2. Convert the user input to an `int` (integer)
3. The output of the program should look like this:
```
$ python cookies.py
How many cookies did you eat? 25
You ate 25 cookies
Which is equal to: 1875.0 calories
```
4. (Optional) you can run `python tests_do_not_touch\test_cookies.py` to see if your program is working correctly. Note that it needs to look like the output for it to work.
