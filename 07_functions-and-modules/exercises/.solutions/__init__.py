# an __init__.py file makes Python treat folders as modules,
# meaning we can import from anything that's been initialised as a module!

# "init" is short for "initialise".

# just make sure you're using TWO underscores on either side of "init" in the filename 
# -> remember the private methods we've looked at when we dir() a python object
